#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the systematic design,development,testing and maintenance of software using engineering principles,like problem-solving,coding and using structured approaches to create realiable and efficient software solutions,it also uses technology to create efficient,expandable solutions that enhance customer experiences and improve productivity for businesses to stay competitive.


2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

2.1 The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): The development of structured programming techniques, such as the use of flowcharts and modular design, marked a shift from unstructured and error-prone coding to more organized and maintainable software.

2.2 The Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): Object-oriented programming (OOP) emerged, allowing for better code reuse, abstraction, and more efficient ways to model real-world systems, leading to increased software complexity and improved software design.

2.3 Agile Software Development (2001): The Agile Manifesto was introduced, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and interactive development. This shift from traditional waterfall models to Agile methodologies has greatly improved the speed and adaptability of software development in response to changing requirements.


3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

3.1 Coding and Implementation
Is the phrase where the actual software is developed and developers write the source code based on the design specifications,ensuring the software meets the required functionality.

3.2 Testing and Quality Assurance
After coding,testing is performed to evaluate and verify the desired requirements as expected to perform and it also identifies bugs and issues that might hinder any sort of arising issues in the long run, Quality assurance does not only work when it comes to the production of goods for example in factories but ensures that the software function as intended,is reliable and meets performance standards.

3.3 Maintenance and updates
Once the software is released,ongoing maintenance is required to fix bugs,improve functionality and update it for new operating  environments or user needs and the regular updates ensure the software remains relavant and secure over time.

3.4 Version control and management
Version Control systems are like (GIT) are used to manage changes to the source code. 
This helps developers track revisions,collaborate efficiently and maintain multiple versions of the software.

3.5 User feedback and improvemrnts
After the software is released,feedback from users is gathered to identify areas for improvement,this feeback drives updates,new features ,bug fixes to enhance the user experience.

3.6 Documents and reporting
Documentation is created to detail the software's architecture,desing,code,and usage therefore this is essential for future maintenance and updates,aswell as for informing stakeholder and users


4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach where each phase of development is completed before moving to the next and Agile is an iterative and flexible approach that develops softwaew in small,incremental cycles called sprints these are two poplular Software Development Life Cycles (SDLC) models used for project management and software development.Each has its own strengths and weaknesses,depending on the project requirements.
Scenarios where Waterfall would be appropriate is when a bank is developing a secure transaction system it uses waterfalll to ensure copliance and strict regulations and fixed requirements and a scenarios where Agile would be appropriate would be when a startup creating food delivery app uses Agile to quickly release updates based on user feedback.


5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer is responsible for designing,coding,testing and maintaining software applications.They analyze requirements,contribute to system desing,with clean code,debug issues,collaborate with team mebers,review code and document their work. They also assist with deployment and maintenancr,while continously learning new skills and staying updated on industry trends.

6.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

6.1 An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development like a code editor and debugging tools.
The importance of IDEs in Software Development:
Improves Developer Productivity – Provides code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools to speed up development.
Error Detection & Debugging – Built-in debuggers help identify and fix issues quickly.
Multi-Language Support – Allows development in various programming languages within the same environment.
Examples of Popular IDEs:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – A lightweight, open-source IDE with extensive plugin support for various languages.
IntelliJ IDEA – A powerful Java IDE with intelligent coding assistance.
Eclipse – A widely used IDE for Java, Python, and other languages.
PyCharm – A specialized IDE for Python development.
Android Studio – The official IDE for Android app development.

6.2 A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that tracks changes to source code, allowing developers to collaborate efficiently and revert to previous versions when necessary.

Importance of VCS in Software Development:
Enables Collaboration – Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.
Tracks Code Changes – Maintains a history of modifications, allowing rollbacks if issues arise.
Ensures Code Integrity & Security – Prevents accidental loss or overwriting of critical code.
Examples of Popular VCS:
Git – The most widely used VCS, known for speed and distributed version control.
GitHub – A cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories with collaboration tools.
GitLab – Similar to GitHub, but offers built-in CI/CD features.
Bitbucket – A Git-based repository hosting service with integration for Jira.
Apache Subversion (SVN) – A centralized version control system used in some enterprise projects.


7.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

7.1 Debugging and Fixing Bugs
Solutions:
Use Debugging Tools – IDEs like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and IntelliJ IDEA offer built-in debuggers.
Write Unit Tests – Testing frameworks like JUnit (Java), pytest (Python), and Mocha (JavaScript) help catch bugs early.

7.2 Managing Tight Deadlines
Solutions:
Use Agile Development – Break projects into smaller, manageable sprints using Scrum or Kanban methodologies.
Prioritize Tasks – Apply techniques like the Eisenhower Matrix to focus on high-priority work first.

7.3 Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technologies
Continuous Learning – Follow tech blogs, read documentation, and take online courses (e.g., Udemy, Coursera, Pluralsight).
Work on Side Projects – Experimenting with new technologies in personal projects helps solidify skills.

7.4)Managing Technical Debt
Solutions:
Refactor Code Regularly – Allocate time to improve code quality after every sprint.
Follow Coding Standards – Use linters and formatters like ESLint, Prettier, and Black (Python).
Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) – Write tests before implementation to maintain code quality.

8.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their Provide strategies to overcome these challenges

8.1 Unit Testing
Testing individual components or functions of a program in isolation which is performed by developers using frameworks like JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), or Mocha (JavaScript).
A strategies to overcome the challenge of unit testing is by writing meaningful test cases,maintaining test cases as codes evolve,testing automation and coverage by handling dependencies like (External Systems or APIs).

8.2 Integration Testing
Tests the interaction between multiple components or modules by detecting issues in communication between integrated parts (e.g., APIs, databases, services,which approach includes Top-Down, Bottom-Up, and Big Bang integration testing.
The strategies on how to overcome challennges faced by (Intergration Testing) are identifying failures in module interactions,managing dependencies between components and creating a realistic test environment.

8.3 System Testing
Tests the entire system as a whole to verify it meets functional and non-functional requirements,Conducted in an environment similar to production which includes performance, security, usability, and stress testing.
Strategies to overcome challenges of (System Testing) by ensuring the test environment matches production,handling performance,security testing,detecting hidden or Intermittent Bugs and managing large and complex test cases.

8.4 Acceptance Testing
Confirms if the system meets business requirements and is ready for deploymennt and determines whether the system is acceptable for release and includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT) (performed by end users) and Beta Testing (real-world testing by a limited audience).
Strategies to overcome challenges when it comes to (Acceptance Testing) are by providing user inconsistent or delayed feedback,lack of time for thorough testing,changing business requirements and  ensuring realistic test scenarios.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1.Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Is the process of designing and refining prompts to effecitively communication with AI models,ensuring they generate accurate,relevant,useful responses ,it involes structuring queries in a coear,specific and strategic manner to optimize the AI's output for tasks such as content creation,problrm-solving and automation

2.Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology."
Improved Prompt is transforming customer service in the retail industry, with examples of companies like H&M,Walmart and the likes are using AI chatbots.
Reason why the Improved Prompt is More Effective is beacause:
1. Specific Topic – Instead of the broad term "technology," the improved prompt focuses on artificial intelligence in customer service.
2. Clear Scope – It narrows the discussion to the retail industry, preventing irrelevant information.
3. Concise and Direct – The prompt avoids unnecessary words while still being precise.
4. Expectation for Examples – Asking for real-world examples ensures a more informative and useful response.
